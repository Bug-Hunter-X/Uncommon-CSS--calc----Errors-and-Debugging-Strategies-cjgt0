# Uncommon CSS `calc()` Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates some uncommon issues that can arise when using the CSS `calc()` function and provides solutions to address them. The `calc()` function, while powerful, requires careful attention to detail to avoid unexpected results. 

Common problems include:

- **Operator Precedence:** Incorrect order of operations can lead to wrong calculations.
- **Unit Mismatches:** Mixing different units (e.g., pixels and percentages) can cause unexpected behaviors.
- **Nested `calc()` Expressions:**  Complex nested calculations can be difficult to debug and may produce unexpected outcomes.

The example demonstrates these problems and their solutions, emphasizing the importance of thorough testing and clear coding practices when working with `calc()`.
