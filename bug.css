The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it sometimes leads to unexpected results due to operator precedence or unit mismatches. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px)` might not work as expected if the parent element's width is not explicitly set.  Another common issue is using `calc()` with different units (e.g., `width: calc(100% - 20em)`), which can cause the browser to interpret the calculation incorrectly.  Furthermore, nested `calc()` expressions can become difficult to debug and can lead to unexpected behaviors.
